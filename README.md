# Northern Lights Air (NLA) Customer Loyalty Program Analysis

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the loyalty program data from Northern Lights Air (NLA), a fictitious airline based in Canada. The primary objective is to evaluate the impact of a promotional campaign on loyalty program enrollments and other related factors. The dataset includes loyalty program signups, enrollment and cancellation details, and additional customer information.

## Key Areas of Analysis

1. **Promotional Campaign Impact**: Evaluating the success of a campaign aimed at increasing loyalty program memberships.
2. **Demographic Adoption**: Analyzing which demographics were more inclined to enroll in the loyalty program during the campaign.
3. **Summer Flight Bookings**: Assessing the effect of the promotional campaign on the number of flights booked during the summer months.
4. **Flight Activity by Province**: Understanding regional differences in flight bookings among loyalty program members.

## Insights

### Successful Promotion
- The promotional campaign led to a significant net increase in loyalty program memberships, indicating its effectiveness in attracting new members.

### Demographic Patterns
- The campaign saw higher adoption among certain demographics, particularly among individuals with a Bachelor's degree and those who are married, suggesting that future campaigns could be tailored more specifically to target these groups.

### Increased Summer Activity
- There was a notable increase in flight bookings during the summer months following the campaign, suggesting that the promotion not only boosted loyalty program enrollments but also encouraged immediate travel activity.

### Regional Flight Activity Variations
- The analysis of flight activity by province revealed significant regional variations, with Ontario and British Columbia leading in total flights. This points to a strong market presence in these provinces and potential areas for growth in others.

## Strategic Considerations

### Tailored Marketing Strategies
- Future promotional campaigns can be designed to target demographics showing lower enrollment rates, leveraging insights from the campaign analysis to increase effectiveness.

### Seasonal Promotions
- Given the increase in summer flight bookings, NLA could consider seasonal promotions to capitalize on periods of high travel demand, possibly extending special offers to loyalty program members to encourage booking.

### Enhanced Focus on Key Markets
- Ontario and British Columbia, being the highest in flight activity, should continue to receive focused attention. Strategies could include enhancing route availability, offering exclusive loyalty program benefits, or partnering with local businesses to increase engagement.

### Growth Opportunities in Emerging Markets
- Provinces with moderate to low flight activities represent untapped potential. NLA could explore introducing new routes, customizing loyalty rewards to regional preferences, or conducting market research to understand barriers to engagement.

### Retention Strategies
- While not directly analyzed, the importance of understanding cancellation trends suggests the need for strategies aimed at retaining members, such as improving program benefits, personalized communication, and addressing feedback.
